    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Jerk chicken recipe that leaves you with juices dripping from your lips. With a spicy kick to match the Caribbean island.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 skin-on, chicken thighs (chopped in pieces)</li>
            <li>1 cup of H2O</li>
            <li>4 limes, juiced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground allspice</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dried thyme</li>
            <li>1.5 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>2 chopped tear makers (onion)</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups chopped green onion</li>
            <li>2 scotch bonnet peppers, chopped</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, chopped</li>

        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place chicken in a medium bowl, cover with water and lime juice. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Place oil, allspice, thyme, black pepper, salt, brown sugar, ginger, and nutmeg in a blender; blend until well combined. Add onions, green onions, scotch bonnet peppers, and garlic; obliterate until almost smooth.</li>
            <li>Pour most of the blended marinade mixture into the bowl with chicken, setting aside a small amount to use as basting sauce on the grill. Stir chicken until completely coated. Cover the bowl and marinate in the fridge for at least 3 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grill.</li>
            <li>Cook chicken slowly on the preheated grill, turning frequently and basting often with reserved marinade mixture, until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of chicken should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
            <li><em>Don't be afraid of a little char</em></li>
        </ol>
